# Student Management System in Redux Toolkit and React Redux

Welcome to the **Student Management System practice project**. This repo demonstrates how to structure a modern React app using **Redux Toolkit for state management and React Redux for component integration**. It also includes examples of making API calls to a backend, handling async flows with **createAsyncThunk**, error handling, and debugging patterns.
